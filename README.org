#+TITLE: kanban - Agile Workflow for Ruby

* Description

  Kanban provides tools to model task flow in distributed apps.

** Create a Backlog

   #+BEGIN_SRC ruby
     require 'redis'
     require 'kanban'

     backlog = Kanban::Backlog.new backend: Redis.new
   #+END_SRC

** Add some tasks to your shiny new Backlog

   #+BEGIN_SRC ruby
     task = { 'foo' => 'bar' }
     5.times { backlog.add task }
   #+END_SRC

** (Elsewhere) Stake a claim on a task from the backlog

   #+BEGIN_SRC ruby
     task_id = backlog.claim  # Will block until there is a task, if the backlog is empty or all tasks are being worked.
     details = backlog.get task_id
   #+END_SRC

** Mark a task as complete (or unworkable)

   #+BEGIN_SRC ruby
     backlog.complete task_id
     # or backlog.unworkable task_id
     backlog.done? task_id  # => true
   #+END_SRC

* Notes
  - Claims expire after awhile (default 3 seconds), and become eligible to
  be worked by something else.
